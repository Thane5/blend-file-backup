A Blender plugin to easily create backups of the currently opened blend file.

It will add a new button under "File" -> "Save Backup", which will save a backup blend file.
The file will be saved next to your current blend file, in a folder called "backup" (name can be changed in preferences). 

Based on an addon by [sambler](https://github.com/sambler)
